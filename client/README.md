This app compiles articles collected from the New York Times website. A user enters a keyword, a starting date, and an end date into a form and relevant articles published within the specified time span are returned. The user may choose to save particular articles into a "Saved Articles" section. He or she may also delete articles from that section.

This app was built using a number of different technologies, including React, MongoDB, mongoose, Express, Node.js, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS, Javascript, axios, and Heroku.

An avenue for future development would be to add more search parameters to allow a user to further customize their search results. More time could also be spent on making a better-looking interface.
